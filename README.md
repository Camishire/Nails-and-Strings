# Nails-and-Strings
We have a board with nails hammered into it along a straight line. Any two nails can be connected with a string. The task is to connect some pairs of nails with strings such that:
- Every nail has at least one string tied to it.
- The total length of all strings used is minimized.

Input :
- The first line contains a natural number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of nails.
- The second line contains n distinct integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10,000), representing the coordinates of the nails on the line.

Output : print the minimum possible total length of all strings used.
